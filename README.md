# Ra3y
I.Motivation and Description of the application

  A. Motivation
    A lot of people these days face the problem of having to deal with the
    issue of keeping their pet with someone they know during their flight or
    during a very long trip. Social Media is a method where users can try to
    communicate with someone to take care of their pet. However, with safety
    issues and concerns people tend to ignore using social media and try to keep
    them with their friends and family, who may have little or no knowledge of
    how to take care of a pet. That is why we came up with the idea of creating
    an application, “Ra3y” to try and address this issue.

  B. Description of Application
    Ra3y is an application that allows users to search for keepers for their
    pets during a trip or a situation where the user cannot be accompanied by
    his/her pet.
